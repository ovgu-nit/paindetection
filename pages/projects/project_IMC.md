## Motivation
Previous projects at the NIT research group resulted in advacements in the area of pain monitoring through the creation of the datasets BioVid and X-ITE. These datasets are recorded in a laboratory environment with healthy patients that are fully oriented. This however may lead to a reality gap when AI-based models are trained on these and then applied to real world settings. Additionally, since the effecxtive communication is alredy problematic with fully oriented patients, the problem gets even more severe with not fully oriented or non communicative patients. These patients can then include sleeping or comatose patients but also patients with mental impairments such as alzheimers. Thus, it is imperitive to include such patients as a focus group to guarantee that the pain monitoring system still work reliable and robust on even these groups. 

## Goals

The research project consits of three major steps. First a new database has to be created that is based on a real world scenario. For this purpose a recording rig was set up in the intermediate care unit of the university hospital in Ulm, Germany. Since September 2024 pateints, that are in the immediate recovery after abdominal surgery, are recorded for a duration of 24 hours, caputuring a video of the face as well bio-signals. This dataset should then be used to verify all developed AI-based models, if they perform reliably enough in such a real world scenario. In a second recording block, the focus shall be soley on not fully oriented and non communicative patients.
