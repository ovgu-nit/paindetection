The AI-based pain detection at NIT consits of two DFG funded research projects. These two projects focus on developing and testing AI-based methods to reliably detect pain in humans. Thus, the first project aims at using the knowlegde from our previous projects, which resulted in the creation of the pain databases BioVid and X-ITE, to develop a reliable, robust and effective pain detection system based on all available modalities. These modalities range from physiological bio-signals such as ECG, Skin activity ,and muscle activiy to video based methods of the face or the body. 

The second research project focuses then on transfering the developed solutions from the laboratory enviornments of BioVid and X-ITE to real world settings. For this purpose, the project aims to create a new dataset from real patient after abdominal surgery in the intermediate care unit of the university hospital ulm. This dataset allows to verify and transfer the AI models to real world settings. 

The projects are supported by the DFG with the grants Pain analysis Nr. AL 638/20-1 and AL 638/19-1 until 2027.
