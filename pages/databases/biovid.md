## Description
The objective measurement of subjective, multi-dimensionally experienced pain is still a problem that has yet to be adequately solved. Though verbal methods (i.e., pain scales, questionnaires) and visual analogue scales are commonly used for measuring clinical pain, they tend to lack in reliability or validity when applied to mentally impaired individuals. Expression of pain and/or its biopotential parameters could represent a solution. While such coding systems already exist, they are either very costly and time-consuming, or have been insufficiently evaluated with regards to the theory of mental tests. Building on the experiences made to date, we collected a database using visual and biopotential signals to advance an automated pain recognition system, to determine its theoretical testing quality, and to optimize its performance. For this purpose, participants were subjected to painful heat stimuli under controlled conditions.
