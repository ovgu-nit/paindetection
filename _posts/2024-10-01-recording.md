## Start of the data recording in the Intermediate Cate Unit of the university hospital Ulm

At the end of September, a team from the NIT group visited the project partners at the University of Ulm. Together with colleagues from the Department of Medical Psychology, a recording setup was constructed in the intermediate care unit under the supervision of Prof. Dr. med. Eberhard Barth.

After testing the setup and providing a general introduction to the recording procedure, the first recordings were quickly completed. In its tested configuration, the setup now reliably records physiological data (ECG, EDA, and frontalis EMG) as well as two frontal video streams over a 24-hour period.

To ensure continuous video monitoring without interfering with the patients' recovery, a monochrome near-infrared (NIR) camera combined with an NIR light source was employed.
