## Towards a reliable multimodal AI monitoring system for pain detection and quantification

Accurate and robust pain intensity detection has significant
implications for patient monitoring and rehabilitation, especially in per-
sonalized treatment and management. Benefiting from the complemen-
tarity of multiple modalities, multimodal fusion-based methods for pain
intensity classification have garnered widespread attention. In this study,
we propose an novel Bi-Modal Fusion framework based on Electrodermal
Activity (EDA) and Electromyography (EMG) for pain classification.
This framework combines LSTM with an attention module in a unified
block to learn complex dynamic features from biosignals, effectively cap-
turing both global and local patterns. Meanwhile, focal loss is used as
the loss function to mitigate the impact of class imbalance during model
training. Through extensive experiments, our method achieves an aver-
age accuracy improvement of 3.31% compared to SOTA across 11 sub-
datasets of X-ITE pain database, with a notable improvement of 7.20%
on the Reduced Electrical Tonic sub-dataset (RETD). Our research not
only validates the effectiveness of the proposed method but also high-
lights its robustness across different modalities and sub-datasets. These
findings lay a solid foundation for our long-term goal of developing an
accurate and robust clinical multimodal AI monitoring system for pain
detection and quantification.
