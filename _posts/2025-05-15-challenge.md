## Announcement of the X-ITE pain challenge at ACII 2025

We are happy to announce the X-ITE pain challenge at the 2025 international conference on affective computing and intelligent interaction. The challenge focuses on developing AI-based solution for classifying the low and medium pain samples in the X-ITE database. This is challenging since the expression of pain is individual and very fluent within those two classes and thus worth examining. The challenge provides samples from 26 X-ITE participants in short 10 second windows, covering all available modalities. From June 10^th a small test set will be available without a ground truth that will be used to determine the winner of the challenge. The winners will then be presented in the corresponding workshop at the ACII 2025 in Canberra, Australia on the 11^th of October 2025.
